# forloop

I dont like recursions, for loops are wayyyy better

I dont like exceptions since I dont like the concept of the programm still running even after an error occurs, but I understand why they should be used, I just wont use them if I have the choice and the programm isnt important

I hate error handling since in my opinion if the user cant put in the correct data, they shouldnt be allowed to use my code (even if I dont have any good code), except if the person is nice like some old grandma or someone like my mom who doesnt understand technology

install apt sudo opsec debian.exe
